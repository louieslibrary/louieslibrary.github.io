### Beowulf

### What is this book about?
This book is actually an old English epic poem written by many anonymous authors and historians disagree when it was written. In the version I am writing about it is retold as a story about the slaying of beasts, such as Grendel and his mother.

### Who is the main character?
The protagonist of this story is Beowulf, a warrior-prince who frees the land of Denmark from hideous monsters and gains glory throughout Europe.

### What is your favourite thing about this book?
My favourite thing about this book is the thrilling battles between good and evil and the detail that the author paints them in. It really makes you feel like you're there, watching the characters battle against dragons, devils and so much more.

### Who would you recommend this for?
I would recommend this to people 7-12 as some parts are gory and scary. If you get scared easily this book is not for you.
