## Spaceboy


### What is this book about?
This book is the newest out of all of David Walliams’s books and it is most definitely the best. The story is about an alien lands in Ruth’s backyard. She hides him from her evil aunt and does everything she can do to stop the military from getting him. This heartwarming adventure is one of the many that Walliams will guide you through.

### What is your favourite thing about this book?
I love the humour and fun that this book brings you through. It is immersive and is so lifelike it almost pulls you into the book. Another quality this book possesses is that you can read it many times and never get bored.

### Who would you recommend this to?
I would recommend this to somebody 6-11 as this has no gory or scary parts.
