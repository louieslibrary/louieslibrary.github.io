# Varjak Paw
by SF Said

### What is this book about?
This book is about a cat who must learn to fight to survive the dark and dangerous streets outside his cosy home. The streets are extra dangerous due to the mysterious vanishings, the gentleman (who is not at all gentle) and his black cats. He must learn the Way, an ancient technique that is taught to him by his ancestor, Jalal. He will use this to fight the black cats to save himself and his family.

### What do you like about this book the most? 
I like the mix of human and nonhuman species in this book. It really gives you a sense of what the cats, dogs and humans are thinking and doing. This book is very detailed and extremely interesting.

### What are some details about the protagonist?
He is a pure-bred mesopotamian blue but his favourite colour is red.
