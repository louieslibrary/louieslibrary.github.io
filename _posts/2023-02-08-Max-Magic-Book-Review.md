### Max Magic
by Stephen Mulhern


### What is this book about?
This book is about Max, who discovers an old magician’s hat in his grandma’s house. After he touches it he gains magical powers. He must learn how to not only use them but to use them for good. This touching story of magic and power never gets old.

### What do you like the most about this book?
I love the detail and plot of this book but the best thing about this book is the way that the author drew up a book and then splashed it with colour, liveliness and so much more.

### Who would you recommend this to?
I would recommend this to someone from 6-9 years old.
