### Kay’s Anatomy


### What is this book about?
I usually don't make book reviews about non-fiction books but this time I am. This book is all about the body and anatomy with the author being Dr Adam Kay and the illustrator being Henry Paker. It shows the body in a funny way and has lots of jokes and it really shows that our bodies all have small quirks and details that make us different and unique. 

### What is your favourite thing about this book?
 My favourite thing about this book is the humour and jokes that really makes the book what it is. Another good thing about this book is the amount of detail. It makes it detailed enough to understand all about the topic he is writing about but not so detailed that it starts getting gory and makes you squeamish.

### Give your top 5 facts from this book?
 1. All added up, you blink for one month every year. That's enough time to bake 700 cakes wasted every year!
2. The Ancient Egyptians were the first people to know how to fix broken bones. Talk about an old cure!
3. Your nerves send messages at 250 miles per hour. For reference, that’s more than three times the motorway speed limit!
4.  Your brain can process 400 billion things in half a second (more or less).
5. There are 5 million hairs on your body. That’s the same number of people in Ireland (give or take a few).

### Who would you recommend this to and why?
Anyone! This book is overall friendly to all ages and has not got any gory or scary bits. I would say anyone from 5-13 can read this book.

### Summary:
Great book with lots of detail and description. Definite 10/10
