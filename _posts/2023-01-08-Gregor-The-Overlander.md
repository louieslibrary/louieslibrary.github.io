### What is this book about?
This book is about Gregor, who finds a mysterious shaft in his laundry room. He discovers that he is the warrior in an ancient prophecy. He must fight giant rats to find his father who disappeared years ago. This book is fast paced and makes your heart beat. I would recommend this book to 7-11 year olds.

### What do you like about this book the most?
I like the work that was put into the plot and storyline for this book. It really makes it hard what to expect next. This book is unique and special and I’ve never read anything like it.

### What are some quirky details about the protagonist?
I have had a hard time thinking of something to write about in this paragraph as there are not many details about the character. He doesn't have a special ability and when the book describes him he doesn’t sound like a warrior at all and he was very surprised when he found out.
