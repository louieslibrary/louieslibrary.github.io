### What is this book about?
This book is about Milo, who one day is delivered a mysterious turnpike tollbooth. When he goes for a ride in it, he gets driven to strange lands he’d never heard of before. From the doldrums and their lazy inhabitants, to the mountains of ignorance where the demons dwell, there is much to be expected from this book. Every bookworm needs this book.

### What do you like about this book?
I really like the way this book is so funny and has such a heart to it. It uses a mix of wordplay and expressions to make it so funny you can’t stop reading it. The places and characters make it so complicated but still so simple and you don’t forget a name or mix up the characters in the middle of the book. It is so interesting you can read it over and over again without getting bored of it. This book is for all ages and I hope anyone will enjoy it as much as me.

### What are some quirky details about the protagonist?
What is different about this book is that the main character has nothing in particular that is different which is why I have decided to tell some details about the other characters. One detail is that the watchdog is a dog with a clock on its side. I really enjoyed all the details made into the characters.
